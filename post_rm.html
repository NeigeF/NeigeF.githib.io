           <h2> What is radial migration?</h2>

	   <p>
	   In the Milky Way and similar disk galaxies, the disk stars rotate about the Galactic center.
	   But they are subject to various perturbations, that modifies their orbits. These 
	   perturbations can have different nature and different effects: stars orbits can become
	   eccentric, or kinematically heated, due to some resonances or scatter events with
	   giant molecular clouds. Other processes make stars change Galactocentric radius, but 
	   without much heating. The effect is often called 'radial migration'.	   
	   Non-axissymmetric perturbations can redistribute stars over large distances. As Noether's
	   theorem says: to a particular symmetry in a system is associated a quantity that is conserved.
	   If the system is axissymmetric, then angular momentum should be conserved. But in disk galaxies,
	   there are non axissymmetries, like spiral arms, or a bar, etc. These are over densities of stars
	   and gas and dust, that contribute significantly to the potential of the disk. 
	   These non axissymmetries exert torques on the stars. And the stars change angular momenta.
           </p>

	   <p>
           Perturbations have a stronger net effect when they occur several times, and at
	   the same place in the same direction: then the effects add up. These happen over resonances.
	   As first postulated by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.336..785S/abstract">
           Sellwood & Binney(2002)</a>, in a simple system composed of a disk and spiral arms that
           rotate as solid bodies with a rotation speed $\Omega_p$, the Jacobi integral is conserved:
	   $E_J = E - \Omega_p L_z, $ which leads to changes of radial action and angular momentum as
	   $$\Delta J_R = \frac{\Omega_p - \Omega}{\kappa} \Delta L_z.$$ 
	   We see that at co-rotation,
	   i.e. where $\Omega = \Omega_p$, the changes of radial action $\Delta J_R$ are zero even though
	   the changes of angular momentum $\Delta L_z$ can be large: the non-axissymmetries exert
	   gravitational torques on the stars $\mathcal{T} = \frac{\mathrm{d}L_z}{\mathrm{d}t}$ causing
	   angular momentum changes.
           </p>

	   <p>
	   The animation below illustrates this effect in a simple disk: a star initially on a near-
	   circular orbit, very close to co-rotation, is pulled by the spiral arms. When the spiral
	   arm is behind the star, it applies a negative torque. So the star loses angular momentum and
	   its orbit size decreases. It then starts to rotate faster than the arms, at catches up the other
	   arm in front of it. As they get close, the arm before the star exerts a positive
	   gravitational torque. The star gains angular momentum and its orbit size increaes.
