		   <h3><a href="post_rm.html">Radial Migration</a> is Cool</h3>
	   Looking at the present-day kinematics stars in the Milky Way disk, and
	   making a model for formation and evolution of these stars orbits, it seems
	   that most of the dynamical evolution of the Milky Way disk remained cold:
	   orbits change size (or angular momentum), but remain close to circular,
	   without increasing eccentricity much. This is illustrated on the Figure on 
	   the left, showing how angular momemtum and radial action spread as a function
	   of time after birth. We see that angular momentum (dark brown) spreads about
	   10 times faster than the radial action (orange), which 
	   quantifies the amount of random radial motion (or 'hotness') in the orbits: the disk evolves a lot,
	   but remains cold! It can have several implications if it also happens to other
	   disk galaxies, driving the disks to look exponential, and to loose dynamical memory
	   of their birth conditions. See the analysis <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200204622F/abstract">here</a> and a very quick animation introducing radial migration <a href="post_rm.html">there</a>.

	   <h3>Inside-out Growth of the Galactic Disk</h3>
           Modelling the radial-dependent star formation history of the Galactic disk,
	   and accounting for the effect of radial mixing (weakening age gradients), we
	   fit the age-[Fe/H]-spatial distribution of APOGEE stars. The best
	   fit model implies that the Milky Way disk likely grew from inside-out, of about
	   43% over the past 8 Gyr. This compares well to redshift-size relations
	   seen in other disk galaxies.
	   The best fit star formation history for the Milky Way's low-alpha disk is 
	   plotted on the right: the star formaton time-scale increases with radius.

           <h3>MW disk stars: migrating 3 kpc scale?</h3>
	   Constructing a simple model for the Galactic disk, modelling when stars were born and with
	   what metallicity, one can predict the scatter in the age-metallicity relation of disk stars
	   that is resulting from radial orbit migration (modelled as a global diffusion process in 
	   Galactocentric radius). The inferred strength of radial orbit migration is quite strong,
	   implying a migration scale of 3.5 kpc over the disk life time. The radial migration model
	   is illustrated on the left, and the paper available <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...865...96F/abstract">here</a>

           <h3>APOGEE Selection Function</h3>
           Galactic density fitting by star counts requires to know and understand how stars in one's
           data set were selected. APOGEE selection function is spatially complex, but opens the door
           to many interesting projects when included in such model.
           For the inside-out work described above, we have (only approximately and incompletely)
           approximated APOGEE selection function. It is available as a fits table with a detailed
           description <a href="https://github.com/NeigeF/apogee_selection_function">here</a>.

           <h3>Nucleosynthesis in black hole accretion disks</h3>
           Can accretion disks around black holes reach the extreme temperatures and densities needed
           for nuclear fusion to occur? In some particular cases of extremely high accretion rates
           involving unstable mass transfer, perhaps some elements can be synthetized and released
           in winds. An example of isotopes mass fractions profiles ina disk is illustrated here.
           I explored this question in a very simplified way (and not always correctly)
           during my MSc, the thesis is available <a href="http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=8912003&fileOId=8912097">here</a>.
